<ul>
    <li><b>Prototypes are the blueprint</b></li>
    <li>Prototypes are a convenient way to <em>define</em> types of objects, but they are a feature of functions</li>
    <li>Serve a similar purpose to that of <em>classes</em> in classical object-oriented languages </li>
    <li>Prototypes predominant use is to produce a classical style of object oriented code and inheritance</li>
    <li>Prototype property (property available in all functions) is really only useful when used with a constructor.</li>
    <li></li>
