// notes on grunt and gulp

	*Gulp
		*def:'Streaming BUild System'
			*not real clear info like the Grunt below info
				* ill come back to it - but it may be easiest to include it in a taskRunner category
    *First steps to work with it:
			* install globally with npm 
			* create a package.json file or use npm init to make one
			* install locally in project folder// npm install gulp --save-dev
			* greate the gulpfile.js with the one liner require and good
		* from Tut by andy carter
		* url http://andy-carter.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-task-runner-gulp
		* Concatenation Files with Gulp
		* notes
			* Gulp on its own doesn't do a lot
			* plugins and tasks need to be added to gulpfile
		* to concatenate files - gulp-concat plugin is needed
		* // npm install gupl-concat --save-dev
		* next: add task to gulpfile: instructs Gulp to concatenate some files. Ie. the project's Javascript files.
		* see fullstacklocalsandbox for gulpfile
		* gulp command: excutes the gulpfile.js

		*MINIFY	the JavaScript with Gulp
		* in this case we now can minify the concatenated file
		* Steps:
			* install a plugin
			* modify the gulpfile - add or modify a task
			*minifying uses gulp-uglify & another plugin called gulp-rename
        *Image Optimisation with Gulp
            *uses: gulp-imagemin and gulp-cache
        *Watching for Changes
            *what is it
            * at the moment we need to run gulp each time we amke a chnge to a file
            *gulp can watch for changes and automatically run tasks.
            *Unlike Grunt, Gulp can do this out of the box. So that means no plugin
            *Watch Task


	*Grunt
		*def: 'the JavaScript Task Runner'
			*what is a task Runner
				*Automation: automates minificaton, compilation, unit testing, linting
		*Gruntfile: onced configured thru that file - the task runner can do all the mundane work for you.
